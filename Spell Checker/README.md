    # Husam Almanakly - DSA2 Program 1

    This program implements a Hash Table data structure, with the purpose to 
    read in and spell check a given document (given a dictionary). This file
    (hash.cpp) contains all the files and implementations of the Hash Table data
    structure, required from the header file. 

    The File labelled spellcheck.cpp parses the inputted dictionary, inserting elements into a 
    hash table, and reads in a text document. It checks if each item exists in the hash table
    and records which items are unknown, (including words above 20 characters).

    Makefile is provided, run make to create the executable spell.exe
